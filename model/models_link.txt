Download an object detect model from here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mP5QqyTzPnTY2g8P5GbIUQadGiPPjakL?usp=sharing

Place the files in this directory so it looks like this:

$ /bin/ls -l
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 2 jph jph 4096 Dec 28 16:10 checkpoint
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jph jph 4301 Dec 25 16:15 label_map.pbtxt

-rwxr-xr-x 1 jph jph 4499 Dec 28 07:52 pipeline.config
drwxr-xr-x 4 jph jph 4096 Dec 28 16:10 saved_model

$ du -ks .
36456   .

(Should also work on non-Linux like Windows)

The models are currently not very good. I have a new machine with a new gpu and should
be able to train better models in 2022.
A gpu is not required to use them but it will be slow.
