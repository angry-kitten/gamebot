Nural net model notes

starting model is from the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U
ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8
This worked ok. But the switch resolution is 1280x720. Scaling the images down to 320x320 may
cause a loss of detail.

This model tried to allocate too much memory at runtime.

This trains ok with my config.
